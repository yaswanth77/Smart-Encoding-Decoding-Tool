# Smart Encoder/Decoder Tool

This Python script provides a smart and user-friendly way to encode and decode text using various methods, including Base64, URL, and HTML encoding.

## Features

- Supports Base64, URL, and HTML encoding/decoding
- Smart analysis of input to suggest appropriate action (encode or decode)
- Command-line interface for easy use
- Interactive prompts for method selection and action confirmation
- Error handling for invalid inputs or failed operations

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `smart_encoder_decoder.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.

## Usage

Run the script from the command line using the following syntax:

```
python smart_encoder_decoder.py [text] [--method base64|url|html]
```

### Examples

1. Basic usage (the script will analyze the input and suggest an action):
   ```
   python smart_encoder_decoder.py "Hello, World!"
   ```

2. Decode a Base64 encoded string:
   ```
   python smart_encoder_decoder.py "SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ=="
   ```

3. Encode a string using URL encoding:
   ```
   python smart_encoder_decoder.py "Hello World!" --method url
   ```

4. Decode an HTML-encoded string:
   ```
   python smart_encoder_decoder.py "Hello &amp; World"
   ```

## How it works

1. The script analyzes the input to determine if it looks like encoded text (Base64, URL, or HTML).
2. It suggests an appropriate action (encode or decode) based on the analysis.
3. The user can confirm the suggested action or choose a different one.
4. If no method is specified, the user can choose the encoding/decoding method.
5. The script performs the selected operation and displays the result.
